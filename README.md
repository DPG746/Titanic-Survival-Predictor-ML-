# Titanic-Survival-Predictor-ML-
# 🚢 Titanic Survival Predictor (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using supervised machine learning techniques. It uses real-world historical data from the [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes information such as:
- Passenger class (`Pclass`)
- Name, Sex, and Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (`SibSp`)
- Number of parents/children aboard (`Parch`)
- Ticket fare (`Fare`)
- Port of embarkation (`Embarked`)

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a predictive model that estimates whether a passenger survived or not based on their features.
